# Payment Popup Feature Implementation

## Overview
This feature implements a freemium model where only the "Overview" tab is accessible to free users, while all other tabs are locked and require a premium subscription.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Tab Locking System
- **Free Tabs**: Overview, SEO Metrics, and Performance are freely accessible to all users
- **Locked Tabs**: All other tabs (Keywords, Technical, Content, AI Models, Top Phrases, AI Results, Competitors, Insights, Version History) are locked for free users

### 2. Visual Indicators
- **Lock Icons**: Small lock icons appear on locked tabs only in collapsed sidebar view
- **Crown Icons**: Purple crown icons indicate premium features in expanded view
- **Tooltips**: Hover tooltips show "Pro Feature" message with upgrade prompt
- **Disabled Styling**: Locked tabs have muted colors and disabled cursor
- **Test Mode Indicator**: Green indicator shows when all tabs are unlocked for testing

### 3. Payment Popup
- **Trigger**: Clicking any locked tab opens a payment popup
- **Design**: Modern, gradient-styled popup with purple/pink theme
- **Content**: 
  - Feature benefits list
  - Pricing information ($29/month)
  - Upgrade and "Maybe Later" buttons
  - Test unlock button (for development/testing)
- **Responsive**: Works on both desktop and mobile
- **Z-Index**: High z-index to ensure popup appears above all content

### 4. User Experience
